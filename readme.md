1. I shared the project into many parts and I tried to solve it step by step.First, I checked the input input box whether it checked or not. If it is checked, I filtered it and then maped.

2.If had more times, I would firstly finish my project untill the end because I couldn't finish it yet. Second, I would constractor my code in order to get it more understandable and neater. And also, I would add more comments in it.

3. The most changelling part for me was to add the menu into the order list.

4. I would like more explanation about reduce method if it is possible please.
